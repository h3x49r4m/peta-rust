Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles.

The Wave Function
-----------------

The quantum state of a particle is described by its wave function $\Psi(x,t)$, which contains all the information about the particle's quantum state.

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x,t)$$

where:
- $i$ is the imaginary unit
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator

Uncertainty Principle
--------------------

One of the most fundamental principles in quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

$$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously.

Applications
------------

Quantum mechanics has numerous practical applications, including:

1. Quantum computing
2. Laser technology
3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
4. Semiconductor devices

The field continues to evolve and discover new phenomena that challenge our understanding of reality.
