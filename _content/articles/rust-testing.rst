Testing Tag Cloud Feature with Rust
====================================

This article is created to test the new real-time tag cloud feature.

Introduction
------------

When you add new articles with tags, the tag cloud should automatically update
to reflect the new tags and their counts.

What We're Testing
------------------

- Real-time tag extraction from frontmatter
- Automatic tag cloud updates
- Tag counting functionality

Rust Programming
----------------

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Concurrency without data races
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Minimal runtime

Conclusion
----------

This article demonstrates that the tag cloud feature works correctly with
new content.
