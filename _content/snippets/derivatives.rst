The derivative of a function represents the rate of change of the function at any given point.

Definition
----------

The derivative of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is defined as:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

This limit represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at point $x$.

Common Derivatives
------------------

Here are some common derivatives:

1. **Power rule**: $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$
2. **Exponential**: $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$
3. **Trigonometric**:
   - $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x$
   - $\frac{d}{dx}(\cos x) = -\sin x$
   - $\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) = \sec^2 x$

Applications
------------

Derivatives have numerous applications in:
- Physics (velocity, acceleration)
- Economics (marginal cost, marginal revenue)
- Engineering (rates of change)
- Optimization problems
