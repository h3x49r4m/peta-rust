The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is one of the most fundamental principles in quantum mechanics, stating that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously.

Mathematical Formulation
------------------------

The uncertainty principle is expressed as:

$$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

where:
- $\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position
- $\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in momentum
- $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$ is the reduced Planck constant

Physical Interpretation
-----------------------

This principle means that:
1. The more precisely we know a particle's position, the less precisely we can know its momentum
2. The more precisely we know a particle's momentum, the less precisely we can know its position
3. This is not a limitation of our measurement tools, but a fundamental property of nature

The uncertainty principle has profound implications for our understanding of reality and the nature of measurement at the quantum scale.
