What is Quantum Computing?
--------------------------

Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that harnesses the phenomena of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally new ways. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in superposition of states simultaneously.

Why Quantum Computing Matters?
-------------------------------

Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers:

- **Cryptography**: Breaking current encryption methods
- **Drug discovery**: Simulating molecular interactions
- **Optimization**: Solving complex optimization problems
- **Machine learning**: Enhancing AI algorithms
- **Financial modeling**: Improving risk analysis

Historical Overview
-------------------

- 1980: Paul Benioff proposes the first quantum mechanical model of a computer
- 1981: Richard Feynman observes that quantum systems are difficult to simulate classically
- 1985: David Deutsch describes the first universal quantum computer
- 1994: Peter Shor develops quantum algorithm for integer factorization
- 1996: Lov Grover develops quantum search algorithm
- 2019: Google claims quantum supremacy with 53-qubit processor

Classical vs Quantum Computing
------------------------------

| Feature | Classical Computing | Quantum Computing |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Basic Unit | Bit (0 or 1) | Qubit (0, 1, or both) |
| Processing | Sequential | Parallel through superposition |
| Error Correction | Well-established | Active research area |
| Current State | Mature technology | Early-stage development |
