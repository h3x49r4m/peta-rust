Overview
--------

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and provide a shared vocabulary for developers to communicate complex design concepts efficiently.

Creational Patterns
-------------------

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Key creational patterns include:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

Structural Patterns
-------------------

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Key structural patterns include:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Proxy

Behavioral Patterns
-------------------

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Key behavioral patterns include:

- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- Chain of Responsibility
- Iterator
- Template Method

Architectural Patterns
----------------------

Architectural patterns express a fundamental structural organization schema for software systems.

Key architectural patterns include:

- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Microservices
- Layered Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
