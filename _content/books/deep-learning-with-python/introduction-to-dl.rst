Introduction to Deep Learning
=============================

What is Machine Learning?
--------------------------

Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of models that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

Types of Machine Learning
------------------------

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Learning from labeled data
   - Classification and regression tasks
   - Examples: spam detection, price prediction

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Learning from unlabeled data
   - Clustering and dimensionality reduction
   - Examples: customer segmentation, anomaly detection

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learning through interaction with environment
   - Decision making and control
   - Examples: game playing, robotics

From Machine Learning to Deep Learning
-------------------------------------

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). Key advantages:

- **Automatic feature extraction**: No need for manual feature engineering
- **Hierarchical representation**: Learning features at multiple levels of abstraction
- **State-of-the-art performance**: Achieving best results in many domains
